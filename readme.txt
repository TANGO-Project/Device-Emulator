DEVICE EMULATOR (DE)

Device Emulator is a component of the European Project TANGO (http://tango-project.eu ).
Device Emulator is distributed under a Apache License, version 2.0.

This work is ongoing.


DESCRIPTION

The Device Emulator (DE) component finds the initial mapping of the tasks onto the nodes/cores (at compile time), i.e., which task should run on each node/core. 
The mapping procedure is static and thus it does not take into account any runtime constraints. At this stage, the DE finds a good solution in low time. 
The DE component addresses this problem by modifying one of the state of the art list scheduling algorithms (HEFT), in a way that
the number of the emulations required is minimized. Thus, a good solution is capable to be found fast. 
The total time needed for the tasks to be mapped onto the nodes/cores is critical for TANGO and this is why the DE emulator component is of high importance. 


FILES
main.m : main function 
input_graphs.m : in this function the user specifies the HW infrastructure. Moreover, the appropriate DAG is read. 
HEFT_single.m: HEFT algorithm for single-thread implementations only
HEFT_multi.m: HEFT algorithm for max-thread implementations only
proposed.m: Proposed algorithm
my_alg1c.m: Proposed algorithm
script.sh: generates the graphs by using the tool in https://github.com/frs69wq/daggen 
DAGs directory: in this directory I have stored 81 different DAGs for 50,100,200 and 300 tasks. 
	If you want to see the DAGs, uncomment the last line in input_graphs.m (warning: this will pop up 81 different windows-graphs)


INSTALLATION GUIDE

Create a directory and paste all the files. Unzip the DAGs.tar file in that directory. 


USAGE GUIDE 

First, the user has to specify the following
  1) in main.m 
      a) 'THRESHOLD'. a <= THRESHOLD <= 2*a, where a is the number of different hardware nodes
      b) 'filename' - the appropriate directory with the graphs
  2) in input_graphs.m 
      a) 'HW_infrastracture' - defines the number and the type of the nodes/cores,  
      b) 'range' array - defines the range of the execution time values  on different nodes 
      c) 'tasks' - defines the # of the tasks 
      d) pointer to 'CCR' - communication/computation value ratio
      e) pointer to 'betaw' - range of execution time values in the reference node
      f) pointer to 'betac' - range of communication time values 

Then, the user has to run main.m file

OUTPUT:
  a) the are 3 different plots showing the quality of the solution as well as the gain in the number of emulations
  b) 'output_myX' array shows which task is executed on which node/core. More specificaly
     1st column specifies the task
     2nd column gives the start time of the current task
     3rd column gives the end time of the current task
     4th column gives the type of node that the current task is executed on
     5th column gives the exact node that the current task is executed on
     6th column gives the number of the threads of that task 
     columns 7-12 specify which core is active during the execution of the current task
  c) 'emulations_myX' specifies which nodes are emulated for each task
  d) 'utilizationX' shows the percetage (%) of each node's/core's usage


RELATION TO OTHER TANGO COMPONENTS

Device Emulator is currently used as a standalone tool in TANGO. However, it will be intergrated with the Device Supervisor, Programing model and runtime as well as ALDE.
