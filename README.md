# Device-Emulator

This is one of the Device Emulator algorithms finding a good mapping fast 

The input graphs are generated by https://github.com/frs69wq/daggen (in this case px.txt file)

This work is ongoing

A detailed documentation is coming soon as well as the other algorithms and the scripts that generate the graphs
